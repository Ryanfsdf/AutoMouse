# AutoMouse

AutoMouse is a mouse recording program that helps to automate simple repetitive tasks. It plays back any recorded
mouse movements at an adjustable speed and works by using the JNativeHook external library for global event capturing.

HOW TO USE: To use the program, press record and move the mouse around. Press stop when you want the recording to end.
To save the recording, enter a save file name into the text box and click save.
To open the recording, enter the name that you saved your file as and click open.
Clicking "F12" on the numpad will automatically play back the recording.


To run the program, get the jar file from out\artifacts and open the file using the command line javaw.exe -jar AutoMouse.jar after opening a command prompt window in the same directory as the jar. Make sure to have the [lastest JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) installed.
